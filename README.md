# Movie Rating Website

This was a programming test for a web dev position. The task was to build a website for movie reviewing with certain
requirements. The actual requirements escape me, but as the good developer I am, I filled all the boxes, so you can
probably decipher the requirements from the results.

## Notes

+ I recall having trouble verifying the commenting working locally (browser blocking local write access), so the "
  Database" part might or might not work as is.
+ The original demo used typekit, which has been removed. Same with Google Analytics and Angular has been changed to use
  the included one instead of Google cached ones.

## What is included

The full Angular application in Finnish. Also, a simple PSD to HTML website they made me do as a test too.

Note: I do not own the rights to the movie cover images used.
